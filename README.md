# Fortnite Auto Scroll

A lightweight program that automatically scrolls down to exploit a Fortnite glitch. By binding the car jump button to the scroll down action, this glitch allows you to jump incredibly high while in vehicles.

## How It Works

This program simulates rapid scroll-down inputs, enabling continuous "jump" actions when the car jump button is bound to scrolling. With this setup, you can achieve impressive heights while in a vehicle!
# MAKE SURE ITS KEYBIND IS SET TO SCROLL-WHEEL DOWN OR IT WILL NOT WORK!
